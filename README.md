# NYC-Parking-Violations-Analysis-and-Predictions

Overview: In this analytical endeavor, I tackled the significant urban challenge of parking management in New York City by delving into the 2023 NYC Parking Violations dataset. The project's goal was to uncover patterns and insights that could inform better parking policies, compliance, and infrastructure planning. Through meticulous analysis, I sought to address the pressing issue posed by the annual issuance of over 20 million parking violations, aiming to improve overall urban parking management without specific mention of the tools used.

Key Contributions:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: My approach involved an extensive cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to ensure its integrity for analysis. This process included the removal of outliers, addressing missing values, and correcting inconsistencies, particularly focusing on vehicle registration states, plate types, and normalizing date formats.

Analytical Problem-Solving: I conducted a deep dive into HR data, focusing on gender-related KPIs to uncover the root causes behind gender imbalance within executive management levels. This aspect of my analysis aimed at contributing to the broader discourse on diversity and inclusion within urban management contexts.

Predictive Modeling: Leveraging the Random Forest Classifier, I developed a predictive model to foresee parking violation codes, enabling a deeper understanding of parking violation patterns. This model's selection was based on its ability to efficiently handle and predict from the dataset's complex and multifaceted nature, achieving a notable accuracy that underscores the predictive model's efficacy.

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Outcomes and Impact:
The project yielded significant insights into NYC's parking violation trends, identifying key areas for policy intervention and potential improvements in parking management strategies. Through this analysis, I aimed to contribute to the creation of a more organized and equitable urban parking system, addressing both the city's economic needs and the residents' quality of life.

Key Learnings:
This project substantially advanced my skills in data analysis and predictive modeling, emphasizing the importance of data integrity, the power of machine learning in pattern recognition, and the critical role of analytical insights in policy formulation and urban planning.
